# Tommaso Bona's Portfolio

This is the template of the site I made for my friend <a href="https://github.com/ParzivalHack">Tommaso Bona (aka ParzivalHack).</a>
It is a pretty simple website, nothing too special, but it follows Tommaso's needs.

In the future I will probably make more responsive and feature-rich websites.
It is also my first public website!
